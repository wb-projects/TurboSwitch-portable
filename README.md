# TurboSwitch

This tool allows you to easily toggle the CPU Turbo Mode on and off within the current power plan.

It's especially useful for laptops that tend to overheat, when full CPU performance is not currently needed and you prefer cooler and more energy-efficient operation.

In systems where the CPU and a dedicated GPU share the same cooling solution, disabling Turbo Mode can help achieve more tolerable temperatures and reduce the likelihood of GPU thermal throttling, potentially extending hardware lifespan (cooler components generally last longer).

Note: Turning off CPU Turbo Mode may cause performance bottlenecks in CPU-intensive applications or games. However, if the software in use only requires low CPU resources, this should not be an issue.

Right-clicking the button opens the application menu, where you can assign a hotkey for quick toggling.

In the same menu, you can also choose whether the button should always remain visible.

To reposition the button on the screen, simply drag it by its border with the mouse.



This application is free to use and runs on any version of Windows, supporting both Intel and AMD CPUs.
